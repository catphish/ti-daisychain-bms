TI Daisychain BMS Master
========================

BMS master for daisychained bq76PL455A slave modules. VERSION 2.

Connection J1
=============

Connect to the daisychain connector at the positive end of a string of
up to 2 strings of up to 16 batteries.

-----------------------------
| B1p1 |  NC  |  NC  | B2p2 |
| B1p2 |  NC  |  NC  | B2p1 |
-----------------------------

B1p1 is pin 1 of the first battery pack
B1p2 is pin 2 of the first battery pack
B2p1 is pin 1 of the second battery pack
B2p2 is pin 2 of the second battery pack

Connection J2
=============

Connect to 12V power and CAN

------------------------
| CANH |  NC   |   NC  |
| CANL |  GND  |  +12V |
------------------------

General Operation
=================

When powered, this module will continuously monitor all conneted battery
modules. It will balance cells when above 4.0V and will report minimum and
maximum voltages by CAN.

Balancing
=========

If any cell voltage is detected as being higher than 4.0V and more than 10mV
higher than the lowest recorded cell voltage, it will be bled until one of
these ocnditions is no longer met. To prevent excessive heat, only one cell
in each battery (16 cell module) will be bled simultaneously. If multiple cells
meet the criteria, the cell with the highest voltage will be selected.
Balancing will be considered complete when no cells meet the criteria for
balancing.

CAN Messages Received
=====================

This modules does not receive CAN messages.

CAN Messages Sent
=================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| CAN ID | Byte 0-3           | Byte 4-5          | Byte 6      | Byte 7       |
| 0x4f0  | Total Pack Voltage | Balance Threshold | Error count | Module count |
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Total pack voltage it the sum of all modules. For parallel packs this value
will be a multiple of the real pack voltage.

Balance threshold will be a non-zero value when balancing is active and
indicates the target voltage, generally this will be 10mV higher than the
minimum cell voltage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
| CAN ID | Byte 0-1   | Byte 2-3   | Byte 4-5      | Byte 6-7      |
| 0x4f1  | Max Cell V | Min Cell V | Max Cell Temp | Min Cell Temp |
--------------------------------------------------------------------

All values are big endian. Voltage values should be interpreted by dividing
the value by 13107. Temperature values are 

The following calculation can be used to convert the readong for an External NTC to a temperature:

float temperature(uint16_t adc) {
  float r = 0.0000000347363427499292f * adc * adc - 0.001025770762903f * adc + 2.68235340614337f;
  float t = log(r) * -30.5280964239816f + 95.6841501312447f;
  return t;
}
